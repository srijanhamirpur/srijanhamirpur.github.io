In olden times, education was given through Gurukul, where anyone could take education by praying to the Guru. If the Guru said yes, then the disciple could also stay there and take knowledge and education. In this way, he could not only receive education from the Guru One would become adept in practical, spiritual and all types of education. In this way a strong tie would be established between the Guru and the disciple. All learning was closely linked to nature and to life, and not confined to memorizing some information.

But now times have changed a lot

Today, education has come out of that era and is moving towards progressive change. Unprecedented changes have taken place in the field of education and people have also realized the importance of education. Nowadays, parents are conscious about their child's education right from the birth and try to get their child educated in the best school as per their capacity. A child's first school is his home. A child learns more from home than from anywhere else.

After that, he gets involved in such a race that he doesn't even know what childhood is, he is in a race to be at the forefront and he has to win. The measure of that victory is its marks and class rank. Despite all this, he starts running after marks, he wants marks, not knowledge. The school also enhances its pride by showing the marks of the children.

But these same children who were toppers in school and had scored good marks, lag behind in competitive exams and take the help of coaching classes for competitive exams.

First of all, marks are not the measure of a child's success. Srijan Academy 

## Vision

We believe every child is different from each other as every human brain is different from another, their grip on all subjects will also be different. According to the child's interest, the child will have a grasp on the subject. Here the child's teacher plays an important role. The child's interest in the subject reflects the teacher's ability. A good teacher can make any boring subject interesting with his ability and skills and can generate children's interest in the subject.

If the student's interest increases then he will acquire knowledge and with that knowledge he will get good marks, his good marks will increase his confidence, and then with the right guidance he can come first in any competition.

Not just competition, he will be able to become a good citizen and help in building the country and Srijan Academy is committed to this.

Our aim is that every student coming here should rule at the top in his/her respective field.
